A vendor offers extracurricular activities in Toronto schools, including a lot of TDSB schools.

We want to analyse what kind of schools are more likely to be chosen by this vendor. Our hypothesis is the vendor predominantly selects schools with more affluent families. To confirm this we use two characteristics of TDSB schools:
1) Learning Opportunity Index calculated by TDSB
2) Presence of Early French Immersion stream in TDSB schools

The analysis is performed using PySpark in [vendor-extracurriculars-choice.ipynb](vendor-extracurriculars-choice.ipynb).
